###### Laxminarayan Dev Yuvak Mandal (LNDYM) was founded by H.H. 1008 Acharya Shree Ajendraprasadji Maharaj to serve as the youth-wing of Swaminarayan Vadtal Gadi (SVG). The organization is operated from Raghuvir Vadi, Vadtal, India with guidance from Shree Swaminarayan Mandir, Vadtal. Currently, H.H. 1008 Acharya Shree Ajendraprasadji Maharaj is the President of the organization, H.H. 108 Bhavi Acharya Shree Nrigendraprasadji Maharaj is the Vice President, and Nana Lalji Shree Pushpendraprasadji Maharaj is the Advisor. LNDYM was established with the intention of educating todayâ€™s youth about the Hindu Sanatan Dharma along with teaching them how to pursue challenges in life and confronting them with optimism as well as creating the opportunity to help the community.

There are various LNDYM chapters throughout the world, some of which include India, the United Kingdom, the United States, Canada, United Arab Emirates, Africa, Australia, Germany, and Poland. Various events take place within these chapters to accommodate the growing interest of others in the Swaminarayan Sampraday.
